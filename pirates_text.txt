ACT I
S
CENE
. 
A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the distance is a c
alm sea, on
which a schooner is lying at anchor. As the curtain rises groups of pirates
are
discovered  some drinking, some playing cards.
S
AMUEL
,
the Pirate Lieutenant, is
going from one group to another, filling the cups from a flask.
F
REDERIC
is seated in a
despondent attitude at the back of the scene.

HORUS.
A

Pour, oh, pour the pirate sherry;
Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
And, to make us more than merry,
Let the pirate bumper pass.
S
AM
.
For today our pirate prentice
Rises from indenture freed;
Strong his arm, and keen his scent is
Hes a pirate now indeed!
A
LL
.
Heres good luck to Frederics ventures!
Frederics out of his indentures.
S
AM.
Two and twenty, now hes rising,
And alone hes fit to fly,
Which were bent on signalizing
With unusual revelry.
A

Heres good luck to Frederics ventures!
Frederics out of his indentures.
Pour, O pour the pirate sherry, etc.

Yes, Frederic, from to-day you rank as a full-blown me
mber of our band.
A

Hurrah!
F

My friends, I thank you all, from my heart, for your ki
ndly wishes. Would
that I could repay them as they deserve!
K
ING

What do you mean?
F
RED
.
To-day I am out of my indentures, and to-day I leave you
for ever.
K

.
But this is quite unaccountable; a keener hand at scuttling a
Cunarder or
cutting out a P. & O. never shipped a handspike.
F
RED
.
Yes, I have done my best for you.  And why?  It was my
duty under my
indentures, and I am the slave of duty. As a child I was re
gularly apprenticed to your
band. It was through an error -- no matter, the mistake w
as ours, not yours, and I was
in honour bound by it.
S
AM
.
An error?  What error?
F
RED
.
I may not tell you; it would reflect upon my well-loved
Ruth.

rises and comes forward.
R
UTH
.
Nay, dear master, my mind has long been gnawed by the canke
ring
tooth of mystery.  Better have it out at once.
S

R
UTH

When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and dar
ing,
His father thought hed prentice him to some career sea
faring.
I was, alas! his nurserymaid, and so it fell to
my
lot
To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a
pilot

A life not bad for a hardy lad, though surely not a high
lot,
Though Im a nurse, you might do worse than make your b
oy a pilot.
I was a stupid nurserymaid, on breakers always steering,
And I did not catch the word aright, through being hard o
f hearing;
Mistaking my instructions, which within my brain did gyra
te,
I took and bound this promising boy apprentice to a
pirate
.
A sad mistake it was to make and doom him to a vile lot.
I bound him to a pirate  you  instead of to a pilot.
I soon found out, beyond all doubt, the scope of this disa
ster,
But I hadnt the face to return to my place, and break it
to my master.
A nurserymaid is not afraid of what you people
call
work,
So I made up my mind to go as a kind of piratical maid-of-
all-work.
And that is how you find me now, a member of your shy lot
,
Which you wouldnt have found, had he been bound apprentice to
a pilot.
R
UTH
.
Oh, pardon!  Frederic, pardon!
(kneels)
F
RED
.
Rise, sweet one, I have long pardoned you.
R
UTH
.
(rises)
The two words were so much alike!
F
RED
.
They were.  They still are, though years have rolled o
ver their heads. But
this afternoon my obligation ceases. Individually, I love
you all with affection
unspeakable; but, collectively, I look upon you with a dis
gust that amounts to absolute
detestation. Oh! pity me, my beloved friends, for such
is my sense of duty that, once
out of my indentures, I shall feel myself bound to devote
myself heart and soul to your
extermination!
A
LL
.
Poor lad  poor lad!
(All weep.)
K
ING
.
Well, Frederic, if you conscientiously feel that it is
your duty to destroy
us, we cannot blame you for acting on that conviction. Alw
ays act in accordance with
the dictates of your conscience, my boy, and chance th
e consequences.
S
AM
.
Besides, we can offer you but little temptation to re
main with us.  We dont
seem to make piracy pay.  Im sure I dont know why, but
we dont.
F
RED
.
I
know why, but, alas! I mustnt tell you; it wouldnt be ri
ght.
K
ING
.
Why not, my boy?  Its only half-past eleven, and you are
one of us until
the clock strikes twelve.
S
AM
.
True, and until then you are bound to protect our interests
.
A
LL
.
Hear, hear!

The Pirates of Penzance

F
RED
.
Well, then, it is my duty, as a pirate, to tell you tha
t you are too tender-
hearted.  For instance, you make a point of never attacki
ng a weaker party than
yourselves, and when you attack a stronger party you invariabl
y get thrashed.
K
ING
.
There is some truth in that.
F
RED
.
Then, again, you make a point of never molesting an orphan!
S
AM
.  Of course:  we are orphans ourselves, and know what it
is.
F
RED
.
Yes, but it has got about, and what is the consequence? E
very one we
capture says hes an orphan. The last three ships we too
k proved to be manned entirely
by orphans, and so we had to let them go.  One would think tha
t Great Britains
mercantile navy was recruited solely from her orphan as
ylums  which we know is not
the case.
S
AM
.  But, hang it all!  you wouldnt have us absolutely mer
ciless?
F
RED
.
Theres my difficulty; until twelve oclock I would, a
fter twelve I
wouldnt.  Was ever a man placed in so delicate a situat
ion?
R
UTH
.
And Ruth, your own Ruth, whom you love so well, and who h
as won her
middle-aged way into your boyish heart, what is to become
of
her
?
K
ING
.
Oh, he will take you with him.
(Hands
R
UTH
to
F
REDERIC
.)
F
RED
.
Well, Ruth, I feel some difficulty about you.  It is t
rue that I admire you
very much, but I have been constantly at sea since I
was eight years old, and yours is
the only womans face I have seen during that time.  I
think it is a sweet face.
R
UTH
.
It is  oh, it is!
F
RED
.
I say I
think
it is; that is my impression.  But as I have never h
ad an
opportunity of comparing you with other women, it is just
possible I may be mistaken.
K
ING
.
True.
F
RED
.
What a terrible thing it would be if I were to marry this
innocent person,
and then find out that she is, on the whole, plain!
K
ING
.
Oh, Ruth is very well, very well indeed.
S
AM
.
Yes, there are the remains of a fine woman about Rut
h.
F
RED
.
Do you really think so?
S
AM
.
I do.
F
RED
.
Then I will not be so selfish as to take her from y
ou. In justice to her, and
in consideration for you, I will leave her behind.
(Hands
R
UTH
to
K
ING
.)
K
ING
.
No, Frederic, this must not be.  We are rough men, w
ho lead a rough life,
but we are not so utterly heartless as to deprive thee o
f thy love. I think I am right in
saying that there is not one here who would rob thee of
this inestimable treasure for all
the world holds dear.
A
LL
.
(loudly)
Not one!
K
ING
.
No, I thought there wasnt.  Keep thy love, Frederic,
keep thy love.
(Hands her back to
F
REDERIC
.)
F
RED
.
Youre very good, Im sure.
(Exit
R
UTH

K
ING
.
Well, its the top of the tide, and we must be off. F
arewell, Frederic.
When your process of extermination begins, let our death
s be as swift and painless as
you can conveniently make them.
F
RED
.
I will!  By the love I have for you, I swear it!  Wo
uld that you could
render this extermination unnecessary by accompanying me back t
o civilization!
K
ING
.
No, Frederic, it cannot be.  I dont think much of o
ur profession, but,
contrasted with respectability, it is comparatively hone
st.  No, Frederic, I shall live and
die a Pirate King.

Oh, better far to live and die
Under the brave black flag I fly,
Than play a sanctimonious part,
With a pirate head and a pirate heart.
Away to the cheating world go you,
Where pirates all are well-to-do;
But Ill be true to the song I sing,
And live and die a Pirate King.
For I am a Pirate King!
And it is, it is a glorious thing
To be a Pirate King!
For I am a Pirate King!

When I sally forth to seek my prey
I help myself in a royal way.
I sink a few more ships, its true,
Than a well-bred monarch ought to do;
But many a king on a first-class throne,
If he wants to call his crown his own,
Must manage somehow to get through
More dirty work than ever
I
do,
For I am a Pirate King!
And it is, it is a glorious thing
To be a Pirate King!

Oh, take me with you! I cannot live if I am left behind.
F

Ruth, I will be quite candid with you.  You are very
dear to me, as you
know, but I must be circumspect. You see, you are conside
rably older than I. A lad of
twenty-one usually looks for a wife of seventeen.
R
UTH
.
A wife of seventeen!  You will find me a wife of a t
housand!
F

No, but I shall find you a wife of forty-seven, and tha
t is quite enough.
Ruth, tell me candidly and without reserve:  compared wi

I will answer you truthfully, master  I have a slight
cold, but otherwise I
am quite well.

I am sorry for your cold, but I was referring rather
to your personal
appearance. Compared with other women, are you beautiful?

Ah, but lately?

Oh, no; years and years ago.

What do you think of yourself?

It is a delicate question to answer, but I think I am a
fine woman.
F

That is your candid opinion?
R

Yes, I should be deceiving you if I told you otherwise.
F

Thank you, Ruth.  I believe you, for I am sure you woul

my inexperience.  I wish to do the right thing, and if 
I say if  you are really a fine
woman, your age shall be no obstacle to our union!

Skipping rivulet and fountain,
Passing where the willows quiver

Climb the hardy little lasses,
Till the bright sea-shore they gain!

That lion-heart quails at the coming conflict?
F
RED
.
No, Mabel, no.  A terrible disclosure
Has just been made. Mabel, my dearly-loved one,
I bound myself to serve the pirate captain
Until I reached my one-and-twentieth birthday 
M
ABEL
.
But you are twenty-one?
F
RED
.
Ive just discovered
That I was born in leap-year, and that birthday
Will not be reached by me till nineteen forty!
M
ABEL
.
Oh, horrible!  catastrophe appalling!
F

And so, farewell!
M

No, no!  Ah, Frederic, hear me.

They have no legal claim,
No shadow of a shame

Stay, Frederic, stay!

Nay, Mabel, nay!
Tonight I quit these walls,
The thought my soul appalls,
But when stern Duty calls,
I must obey.
D

Ah, leave me not to pine
Alone and desolate;
No fate seemed fair as mine,
No happiness so great!
And Nature, day by day,
Has sung in accents clear
This joyous roundelay,
He loves thee  he is here.
Fa-la, la-la, Fa-la, la-la.
F
RED
.
Ah, must I leave thee here
In endless night to dream,
Where joy is dark and drear,
And sorrow all supreme 
Where nature, day by day,
Will sing, in altered tone,
This weary roundelay,
He loves thee  he is gone.
Fa-la, la-la, Fa-la, la-la.

In 1940 I of age shall be,
Ill then return, and claim you  I declare it!

Swear that, till then, you will be true to me.

By all the Stanleys dead and gone, I swear it!

Oh, here is love, and here is truth,
And here is food for joyous laughter:
He/She will be faithful to his/her sooth
Till we are wed, and even after.

No, Ill be brave!  Oh, family descent,

A crisis, now, affairs are coming to!

That is not a pleasant way of putting it.

No matter; he will not so lead you, for he has allie

P

He has acted shamefully!
M

You speak falsely.  You know nothing about it.  He has ac
ted nobly.
P

He has acted nobly!
M

Dearly as I loved him before, his heroic sacrifice t

endeared him to me tenfold.  He has done his duty.  I will do
mine.  Go ye and do
yours.

This is perplexing.
P

We cannot understand it at all.
S

Still, as he is actuated by a sense of duty 
P
OLICE.
That makes a difference, of course.  At the same time
, we repeat, we
cannot understand it at all.
S
ERG
.
No matter.  Our course is clear:  we must do our best
to capture these
pirates alone.  It is most distressing to us to be the a
gents whereby our erring fellow-
creatures are deprived of that liberty which is so dear to
us all  but we should have
thought of that before we joined the force.

We should!

Chorus of Pirates without, in the distance.
A rollicking band of pirates we,
Who, tired of tossing on the sea,
Are trying their hand at a burglaree,
With weapons grim and gory.
S
ERG

Hush, hush!  I hear them on the manor poaching,
With stealthy step the pirates are approaching.
Chorus of Pirates, resumed nearer.
We are not coming for plate or gold 
A story General Stanleys told 
We seek a penalty fifty-fold,
For General Stanleys story.

Our obvious course is now  to hide.

appearing at ruined

Would be distinctly heard 

So stealthily the pirate creeps,
While all the household soundly sleeps.
Come, friends, who plough the sea,

With a little burglaree!

Tormented with the anguish dread
Of falsehood unatoned,
I lay upon my sleepless bed,
And tossed and turned and groaned.
The man who finds his conscience ache
No peace at all enjoys;
And as I lay in bed awake,
I thought I heard a noise.
M

He thought he heard a noise  ha! ha!

No, all is still
In dale, on hill;
My mind is set at ease 
So still the scene,
It must have been
The sighing of the breeze.

Sighing softly to the river
Comes the loving breeze,
Setting nature all a-quiver,
Rustling through the trees.
M

Through the trees.

And the brook, in rippling measure,
Laughs for very love,
While the poplars, in their pleasure,
Wave their arms above.

M

Yes, the trees, for very love,
Wave their leafy arms above.
River, river, little river,
May thy loving prosper ever!
Heaven speed thee, poplar tree,
May thy wooing happy be.

Yet, the breeze is but a rover,
When he wings away,
Brook and poplar mourn a lover
Sighing,  Well-a-day!

Well-a-day!

Ah!  the doing and undoing,
That the rogue could tell!
When the breeze is out a-wooing,
Who can woo so well?

Shocking tales the rogue could tell,
Nobody can woo so well.
Pretty brook, thy dream is over,
For thy love is but a rover;
Sad the lot of poplar trees,
Courted by a fickle breeze!

At such a time of night as this, so very incompletely

Dear father is, and always was, the most methodical
